#encouragement to watch Sesame Street is associated with an increase of aronud 1.6 points (95% CI: -1.1 to 4.2) on the numbers post-test.  
#Because this is a wide confidence interval that ranges anywhere from a 1.1 point decrease to a 4.2 point increase, this study does not provide
#conclusive evidence that encouragement to watch Sesame Street made a difference.

#Here we might want to do an analysis of whether encouragement to watch Sesame Street actually made a difference in whether 
#the children actually watch Sesame Street!  That is another outcome variable and so deserves its own regression.

#as a sensitivity analysis, we can try dropping some of the pretest scores.
#For example, drop prerelat or preclassif since they are somewhat highly correlated with prenumb
#It does not appear to make much difference in our overall conclusions about encouragement.  Thus, we might as well keep all of them to aid interpretation.
